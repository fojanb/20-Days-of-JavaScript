### :heavy_check_mark: What you should see
- After you enter text into the input box, upon pressing the "Enter" key, your message should show up in the "Last Message Delivered" Section.
- After the "Enter" key is pressed, the text box value should return to an empty text box.
- If no input is submitted, an alert should show (using the "show" class in the CSS file) in the "Last Message Delivered" section and then disappear after 2 second.
