### :heavy_check_mark: What you should see.
- In the case of tip calculator, you should be able to use the calculator to enter an amount of a bill, the number of people who will split the bill, and a selection as to how the service went. And also provide a "reset" button to clear all fields.
- Make sure to run this app on live server, since I have used Module System.


Happy coding! (^_^)
